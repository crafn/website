### Clover engine is now open source under the MIT license!
After a lot of thinking and talking to people a conclusion was reached: it's in the best interest of everyone if [the Clover engine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tum9KOXC2o) is released under some open source license. Furthermore, a very unrestrictive license was chosen because it would most likely be more attractive for contributors than e.g. GPL, and it wouldn't restrict myself so much after someone has contributed to the engine.

So, here it is, the Clover engine [GitHub Repository](http://github.com/crafn/clover)!

It's still undetermined what'll happen to assets and other data of the game.
