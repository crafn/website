### Clover engine is now open source under the MIT license!
After a lot of thinking and talking to people a conclusion was reached: it'd be in the best interest of everyone if [the Clover engine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tum9KOXC2o) was released as open source. Furthermore, the MIT license was chosen because it's simple and more attractive for users than e.g. restrictive GPL. Unrestrictive license also restricts me less in the future after someone has contributed to the engine.

So, here it is, the Clover engine [GitHub Repository](http://github.com/crafn/clover)!

It's still undetermined what'll happen to assets and other data of the game.
