[Splot](http://www.frozenbyte.com/games/splot) is a mobile platformer game released in 2014, published and developed by a finnish game company [Frozenbyte](http://www.frozenbyte.com). I was part of the small development team during three summers and continued some time as part-time along with high school.

My job title was programmer, and it involved working on every area of the code, including physics, graphics, gameplay logic, scripting, animations and audio. Due to the team size it was also natural to take part in solving many design issues.
