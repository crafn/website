<h4>Forest</h4>
<p>This is the first complete level I've made for any game. By the time I started building this I was eight years old, and not knowing English very well I discovered most features of Jazz Creation Station by trial and error.</p>
<p>A decade after I'm still quite happy with it, even though there are some filler parts where I couldn't think of anything interesting to put in. For some reason I had this thought that the whole rectangular area of a level should be used, so I often zoomed out to see where the biggest empty areas are and tried to invent something there.</p>

<h4>Computer virus</h4>
<p>Tubelectric theme was one of my favorites because of the many types of ground tiles and the music, so of course I needed to do a level with it. At this point I started adding really "clever" obstacles on the main path of a level, basically requiring the player to examine the level in JCS or trying everything possible on every tile nearby. This level I didn't finish because new event tiles stopped functioning after the level had grown, and at the time I couldn't figure out why. I think there was some hardcoded limit on how many events a level could have and I had crossed it with this huge level.</p>
<p>Looking at this level makes me feel like creating a new one with better, more indoor-like structure, and with more tubes! There could also be a puzzle making use of the pinball stuff...</p>

<h4>Jungle</h4>
<p>I think this was one of my last levels I made to Jazz 2. It's complete, although nobody, even me, has ever completed it without using cheats; it's a bit hard. I guess it was fun to make the player frustrated, because there are just too many small flying enemies and not enough checkpoints.</p>
<p>Composition and structure-wise this might be my best level though, and there are many puzzly situations I like. I think I forgot to add parallaxing elements to the background.</p>
