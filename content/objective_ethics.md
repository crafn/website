### A formal proof of universal and objective ethics
We prove the central moral claims presented in Universally Preferable Behavior -- A Rational Proof of Secular Ethics (UPB) by Stefan Molyneux, using undergraduate level mathematics to represent exact defnitions, principles, and proofs.

We show that among all internally consistent value structures, a unique structure can be identified by requiring universality and objectivity. This universal and objective value structure is shown to allow all preferences that do not escalate violence in a certain objective sense, and to disallow every choice that does.

Corrections and rebuttals are welcome. If the proof is correct, then the ancient problem of non-subjective ethics has been solved.
