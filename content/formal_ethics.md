### An attempt at formalizing UPB-based ethics
Stefan Molyneux presents a framework for ethics in his book *Universally Preferable Behaviour (UPB) - A Rational Proof of Secular Ethics*, in which commonly accepted moral rules are deduced from first principles. This paper is an attempt at outlining a mathematical formalism for a subset of the philosophical reasoning, namely ethics between actions of two people. This isn't a straightforward translation from the book to the language of mathematics, but an independent sequence of thought being the result of trying to understand the logic of UPB and the derived ethics. Applying the somewhat handwavy mathematical machinery to the common moral test cases seems to agree with the results acquired by Stefan.
